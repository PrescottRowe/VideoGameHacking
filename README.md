# Game hacks!
Please keep these cheats in offline mode. No one likes to play with a hacker. 
# FarCry 4
**FarCry4Trainer.exe**: This is the executable that will inject into your current running far cry. 
>Also please note that when you launch the exe you are injecting to the RAM and if the game is saved it will also save the code injections. Backup your game files to avoid any risk of corrupted files. As you are about to see i went deep on this one, there are a ton of cheats (I love FarCry4)

Cheats include:
>-Arena points

-Disarm enemys on shot
-Fly
-Get max exp

-Health elephant
-No Backpack Limit (limited by ram)
-No croshair disapear

**FarCry4.ct**: In case you want to add or edit the trainer i also provided the cheat image so you can make edits and recompile.
 **Explarrow.ct**: This is probably my favorite cheat honestly, its just infinite exploding arrows. So the game is pretty much the same but now you feel like an apache heli but be careful you still only have 100 health and the game becomes, try not to kill myself.

**assultcube.ct**: May be the most popular game to hack so there are way better cheat tables on other peoples githubs but here is a basic cheat table that i used when i was first learning.
>-Health
-rifle ammo
-armor

-height

-gun speed
